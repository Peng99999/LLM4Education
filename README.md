1.ChatGPT for good? On opportunities and challenges of large language models for education （Learning and Individual Differences 心理学：教育 2区Top）：

摘要：
Large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI. The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.

重点结论：
**我们强调了如何利用这些模型来创建教育内容、提高学生的参与度和互动性，以及个性化学习体验**。关于挑战，我们认为，教育中的大型语言模型要求教师和学习者发展必要的能力和素养，既要了解技术，也要了解其局限性和此类系统意想不到的脆性。此外，要在学习环境和教学课程中整合并充分利用大型语言模型，还需要在教育系统内制定明确的战略，并采用明确的教学方法，重点关注批判性思维和事实核查策略。人工智能在教育领域的应用还面临其他挑战。
